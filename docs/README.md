# Alfred: BAM Statistics, Feature Counting and Feature Annotation

[Alfred](https://github.com/tobiasrausch/alfred) is an efficient and versatile command-line application that computes multi-sample quality control metrics in a read-group aware manner. Alfred supports read counting, feature annotation and haplotype-resolved consensus computation using multiple sequence alignments.
