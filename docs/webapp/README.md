# Web application

Alfred's quality control json files can be interactively browsed with the companion [web application](https://gear.embl.de/alfred). All charts support panning and zooming. Charts can be downloaded as png. Tables of quality control metrics can be downloaded as csv. An overview of all available charts and a most important alignment statistics is below.
